# Covid19-Iran-Simulation-MonteCarlo

Welcome to the Covid19-Iran-Simulation-MonteCarlo project, developed by [Iman Kianian](https://github.com/iman2693/Covid19-Iran-simulation-montecarlo). This project aims to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Iran using the Monte Carlo method.

## Features

The Covid19-Iran-Simulation-MonteCarlo project includes the following features:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: The project uses the Monte Carlo method, a statistical technique that allows for a wide range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action.

- **COVID-19 Spread Modeling**: The project models the spread of COVID-19 in Iran, providing valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.
